Here is my go-to snippet for a consistent, production-ready logger in NodeJS or Typescript :

logger.js

```js
import pino from "pino";
import ecsFormat from "@elastic/ecs-pino-format"; // Optional

export const logger = pino({
  ...ecsFormat(), // Optional
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || "info",
  prettyPrint:
    process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" ||
    process.env.LOG_PRETTY_PRINT === "true",
});
```

What's inside ?

- **JSON logging**: It logs everything in a JSON format. Having JSON logs is extremely useful when you want to parse them with e.g. [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com) or any other log-management service.

- **Debug Context**: It supports adding context objects with your message (yeah, Pino is really awesome).
- **Great Developer Experience**: When running on your local machine, it will display colored, well-spaced logs for a better developer experience, thanks to `pino-pretty`.
- **Default log level**: Using default level "info" avoid spamming a new environment with tons of logs if you forget to set the variable.
- **Nice trick**: The `LOG_PRETTY_PRINT` variable allows us to enable pretty-printing even in production environement. Useful for quick debugging tasks.
- **Optional - ECS format**: I often use Elastic Common Schema as a logging format. It comes with great defaults, and is of course ideal if you are sending your logs to an ELK stack.

That's it! It just works :)

### Usage

Add its dependencies to your project :

```shell
npm i pino
npm i -D pino-pretty
# Optional : Use the Elastic Common Format
npm i @elastic/ecs-pino-format
```

And use it like this :

```js
import { logger } from "logger";

// Simplest example
logger.info("Yay");

// Add more context
const ctx = { user: "foo", action: "delete", reason: "whatever" };
logger.debug(ctx, "User deleted");
```
